                <h3>Why generate test data?</h3>
                <p>You should always have a good
                    volume of mocked up data when testing your application. This will help catch performance issues in
                    your code
                    early on in the cycle as well as issues with the UI. Maybe you need to use a larger width to display
                    the name of your customer because you saw that some customers have long names which are getting
                    trimmed. Or maybe you see that you dont have enough space in your DB for the addresses you want to
                    store.
                </p>
                <h3>Is having realistic data really important?</h3>
                <p>If you are trying to showcase your project as a real time application, it adds a lot of value to
                    actually show realistic names, addresses and data instead of random alphabets typed out in a hurry
                    by you. Creating
                    data and testing it on your app will also add realstic issues like an apostrophe in a name or
                    address which your code might not be able to handle.
                </p>
                <h3>Why use CSV Data Generator?</h3>
                <p>The CSV Data Generator is Light, Easy and Customizable with absolutely NO registration. Other data
                    generators available either do not have the various options provided here OR try and get you to sign
                    in and pay for the more advanced features which are available here for absolutely free!!
                    <br>
                    This is a light-weight solution and all the data gets created entirely on the client side using
                    Vanilla Javascript.
                </p>
                <h3>How many rows/columns can I generate?</h3>
                <p>The CSV Data Generator is a light weight application that has been built using vanilla Javascript.
                    You can create as much data as you like but your browser could crash if you are trying to create 1
                    trillion records for a bunch of columns! So go easy :)
                </p>
