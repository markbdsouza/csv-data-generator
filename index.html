                <h3>Why is test data important?</h3>
                <p> If you're developing an application, you'll want to make sure you're testing it under conditions
                    that
                    closely simulate a production environment. In production, you'll have an army of users banging away
                    at
                    your
                    app and filling your database with data, which puts stress on your code. If you're hand-entering
                    data
                    into a
                    test environment one record at a time using the UI, you're never going to build up the volume and
                    variety of
                    data that your app will accumulate in a few days in production. Worse, the data you enter will be
                    biased
                    towards your own usage patterns and won't match real-world usage, leaving important bugs
                    undiscovered.
                </p>
                <h3>Why is realistic data important?</h3>
                <p>When your test database is filled with realistic looking data, you'll be more engaged as a tester.
                    When you
                    demonstrate new features to others, they'll understand them faster. Real data is varied and will
                    contain
                    characters that may not play nice with your code, such as apostrophes, or unicode characters from
                    other
                    languages. Testing with realistic data will make your app more robust because you'll catch errors
                    that
                    are
                    likely to occur in production before release day.
                </p>
                <h3>Why Mockaroo?</h3>
                <p>There are plenty of great data mocking libraries available for almost every language and platform.
                    But not
                    everyone is a programmer or has time to learn a new framework. Mockaroo allows you to quickly and
                    easily
                    to
                    download large amounts of randomly generated test data based on your own specs which you can then
                    load
                    directly into your test environment using SQL or CSV formats. No programming is required.
                </p>
                <h3>Want to automate test data generation?</h3>
                <p>If you sign in using your Google account, you can download random data programmatically by saving
                    your
                    schemas and using curl to download data in a shell script via a RESTful url.
