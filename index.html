                <h3>Why generate test data?</h3>
                <p>Unless you are in the preliminary stages of creating your application, you should always have a good
                    volume of mocked up data when testing your application. This will help catch performance issues in
                    your code
                    early on in the cycle as well as issues with the UI. Maybe you need to use a larger width to display
                    the name of your customer because you saw that some customers have long names which are getting
                    trimmed. Or maybe you see that you dont have enough space in your DB for the addresses you want to
                    store.
                </p>
                <h3>Why is realistic data important?</h3>
                <p>If you are trying to showcase your project as a real time application, it adds a lot of value to
                    actually show realistic names, addresses and data instead of asd and qwe typed out in a hurry by
                    you. Creating
                    data and testing it on your app will also add realstic issues like an apostrophe in a name or
                    address which your code might not be able to handle.
                </p>
